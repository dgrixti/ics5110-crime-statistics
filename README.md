# US Crime Analysis: Weapon Use Prediction

Welcome to the **Weapon Use Prediction** project! This interactive web application leverages machine learning models to predict the type of weapon (Firearm vs. Non-Firearm) used in crimes based on demographic and contextual features. The app is built using **Gradio** and hosted on **Hugging Face Spaces**.

## üîç **Overview**

The primary goal of this project is to analyze crime data and classify weapon usage using machine learning techniques. The application supports multiple models, including:

- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **XGBoost**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**

The models are trained on a publicly available crime dataset, which includes features such as **Region**, **Victim Age**, **Relationship Type**, and more. The dataset is imbalanced - 102,988 records (67.09%) for "Firearm" compared to approximately 50,523 (32.91%) for "Non-Firearm", and techniques like **SMOTE** were applied to improve model performance.

## üìä **Technical Details**

### **Dataset**
- **Source**: [US Crime Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrayushagrawal/us-crime-dataset)
- **Features**: Demographics, geographic data, relationships, and crime specifics.

### **Models**
- **Random Forest**: Robust ensemble method with SMOTE for handling imbalance.
- **XGBoost**: Boosting algorithm with optimized hyperparameters for precision-recall balance.
- **Logistic Regression**: Lightweight model with decent accuracy.
- **ANN**: Neural network with three dense layers for binary classification.

### **Preprocessing**
- Categorical features: Encoded using LabelEncoder.
- Numerical features: Standardized using StandardScaler.
- Class imbalance: Addressed using SMOTE for minority-class oversampling.
